        <h2>Surfing History</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>How it all began - The History of Surfing
            The Origin in Hawaii</h3>
            
        <div class="flex-container-2">
            <div class="box-4">
                <p>The first surfing references were found in Polynesia. Cave painting from the 12th Century show people
                    riding on waves. In the course of seafarings, Polynesians brought surfing to Hawaii and the sport
                    went
                    viral. Surfing in Hawaii wasn't only a sport but also an important part of the religion. The tree
                    choice
                    was vital and religious rituals were practiced during the surf board shaping. The ceremonies served
                    as
                    protection and to secure the gods' goodwill. Everybody surfed - men, women, children, kings - but
                    there
                    was a strict rule system that regulated who could surf on which spot.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    The first written heritage about the history of surfing was found in James Cook's diary, the
                    European captain who not only discovered new lands but also surfing.
                    The colonization of Hawaii began shortly after that by means of Christian missionaries. The approach
                    of life has been remarkable beforehand but after the settlement it changed a lot. The Hawaiians had
                    to wear clothes and to visit the church frequently and the kids had to go to school. Surfing lost
                    its strong influence in this time but never vanished completely.

                <h3>The Worldwide Diffusion of Surfing</h3>
                <br>
                <p>More famous discoverers like Mark Twain or Jack London - both considerable travel book authors -
                    reported on the sport in the waves and aroused high interest in the population. The history of
                    surfing carried on and more and more tourists had a try at the new sport. Over time, the first surf
                    clubs came up and the beach boys became lifeguards to secure the beaches. The most famous Surfer was
                    Duke Kahanamoku who was born in 1890. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Kahanamoku"
                        target="_blank" title="The Duke">‘The Duke’</a> was a talented swimmer and obviously one of the
                    best surfers on the Hawaiian Islands. In 1912, he competed in the Olympic Games in Stockholm and won
                    the 100-meter freestyle contest, not least because of the crawl technique that he copied from
                    surfing. After his success, he traveled around the world and introduced surfing in all regions where
                    the conditions made it possible e.g. in Australia or California.

                    When Hawaii joined the USA as the 51st state, tourism on the islands boomed as never before.

                <h3>The Evolution of the Surfboard and the Invention of the First Wetsuit
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p> Not only surfing itself, also the tools changed a lot as time goes by. Adhesives which were
                    developed in World War II found a completely new purpose. Joe Quigg invented the round nose and
                    laminated fins that are covered with fiberglass. These innovations made unbelievable manoeuvres
                    possible.

                    In the early 50s Jack O’Neill invented the first wetsuit which protected the surfers from the cold
                    Californian water. The big surf boom happened one decade later. Because of the wetsuit and the
                    smaller boards that provided for radical turns, surfing became a mass sport. Also Hollywood movies
                    like ‘Gidget’ and ‘Endless Summer’ that showed surfing and its lifestyle made the sport bigger and
                    bigger.
                    In the 70s, the Australian Simon Anderson invented today’s 3-fin-system on the shortboard. This was the last eminent step which led to the shortboard as we know it today.
